Calistant Privacy Policy

Hello At Calistant, we believe that understanding your meals shouldn’t feel like solving a math problem. We’re here to help you build healthier habits by making meal tracking easy, smart, and even a little fun. We are not a medical or dietary service. Since this is a personal journey, we do collect some information to make your experience as helpful and personalized as possible.

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) outlines how Calistant handles your personal information during your use of the app. It explains what kind of data is collected, how it’s used, and how your privacy is safeguarded. You’ll also find information about your rights and the choices you have regarding your data. This Policy is closely linked to our Terms of Use, where additional details and definitions are available if you’re curious to explore further.

Calistant is designed for individuals who are 18 years of age or older. If you are under 18, please do not create an account or use Calistant. Our systems are designed to restrict access for individuals below this age. If we discover that a user under the age of 18 has submitted personal information, we will promptly delete the data and close the account to protect their privacy.

Calistant is not a medical advice app
•	Calistant is not a licensed healthcare provider or a substitute for medical advice.
•	All suggestions and insights are generated by AI and should be considered informational only.

•	Calistant does not generate personalized diet plans or allergy-safe recommendations.

Personal Information We Collect

We may collect your personal information through three primary sources: directly from you, automatically as you interact with our Services, and from authorized third parties.

Personal Information We Collect Directly from You

Account and Profile Information. When you sign up for Calistant, you may provide details such as your name, email address, general location (such as country), profile image (if you choose to upload one), username, password, date of birth, and gender.
Food and Activity Diary Data. Calistant includes features that allow you to log meals, track your activity, and monitor your health goals. When using these features, you may voluntarily submit information such as:
•	Eating and nutrition habits
•	Foods, beverages, and medications you consume (including those logged via voice input, text, or barcode scanning), and in the future, possibly groceries purchased via third-party integrations
•	Calorie intake and nutrient breakdown
•	Dietary preferences or restrictions
•	Fitness activity, exercise routines, and related goals (e.g., “increase daily protein intake”)
•	Lifestyle habits such as sleep data
•	Body-related metrics like height, weight, and BMI
•	Information related to physical or health conditions
•	Optional progress photos
•	Notes or reflections about your habits, physical condition, or mindset
Some of this data may be considered sensitive personal information if it directly or indirectly indicates a medical or health condition.
Communications with Calistant. When you contact our team—for example, through customer support channels, feedback forms, or in-app messaging—we may collect your name, email address, and the content of those messages, including any responses you receive from us or from automated support features such as our chatbot.
Social and Community Interactions. If you engage with Calistant via social media platforms, participate in public forums, or contribute to discussion groups that are run by or affiliated with Calistant, we may collect information you post—such as comments, photos, or related contact details—depending on the visibility of the platform used.
Information Shared with Other Calistant Users. If Calistant introduces user-to-user interaction features (e.g., messaging, friend connections, shared goals), we may process information that you share with other users, such as your name, diary entries, progress photos, fitness achievements, or feedback.
Research and Survey Participation. From time to time, you may be invited to participate in surveys, research programs, or beta features. If you choose to take part, we may collect feedback, opinions, and contact details you voluntarily provide.
Event and Registration Information. If you register for any online or in-person event hosted or sponsored by Calistant, we may collect data related to your participation, including name, email, event preferences, attendance records, and related feedback.
Preferences and User Settings. We may store information about your preferences, including communication settings (e.g., email or push notifications), interface and feature choices, and any requests submitted to improve your user experience.
Payment Information. If you purchase a Premium Subscription or any paid feature via Calistant’s platform, your payment details (such as credit card number, billing address) may be processed by a third-party payment processor. Calistant itself does not store or access your full payment credentials but may retain transaction-related metadata (e.g., subscription tier, status, renewal dates) for account management and billing purposes.

Automatically Collected personal Information: Usage, Device Data & Cookies

Calistant may automatically collect certain information related to your device and how you interact with the Services. This includes technical details such as your browser type, operating system, device model, unique identifiers (e.g., IP address, mobile advertising ID, cookie ID), internet service provider, and mobile network operator. We may also collect general location data inferred from your IP address, as well as data on your in-app behavior—such as actions taken, time spent using different features, frequency of use, navigation paths, and clicks on specific links or elements within the app or website.
To gather this information, Calistant uses cookies and other tracking technologies (“Cookies”) to enhance and customize your experience across our Services. These technologies allow us to better understand usage patterns, maintain functionality, improve performance, and deliver relevant content.
Cookies serve multiple purposes, including:
•	Essential Cookies – Required for the operation of the Services, including maintaining secure sessions and preventing abuse or fraud
•	Functional Cookies – Enable additional features, such as remembering preferences, personalizing content, and analyzing usage for future improvements
•	Advertising Cookies – Help deliver personalized ads and promotional messages based on your behavior and interests
What Are Cookies?
Cookies are small data files stored on your device by your browser when you visit a website or use a web-based app. Like many digital platforms, Calistant and its authorized third-party partners may use various tracking technologies—including cookies, pixels, web beacons, SDKs, log files, and local storage mechanisms—to collect information for operational and analytical purposes. Some of these cookies are placed directly by Calistant (“First-Party Cookies”), while others may be set by third-party services we integrate with (“Third-Party Cookies”).

Your ability to manage cookies may vary depending on your location and applicable regulations. Most browsers allow you to modify your settings to:
•	Accept all cookies
•	Reject all cookies
•	Notify you each time a cookie is being placed on your device
Note that if you disable or reject cookies, certain features of Calistant’s Services may no longer function as intended.

For more detailed information on how cookies work and how to manage them, you can visit widely available resources such as www.allaboutcookies.org.
In addition, for jurisdictions requiring explicit consent, you may be presented with cookie consent banners or tools upon first accessing our Services, allowing you to provide or withdraw consent for various categories of cookies.


Personal Information We Receive From Third Parties

What are Third-Parties and Service Providers?
A third party refers to any individual or organization that is not one of the primary participants in a transaction. In the context of an app user, any entity other than your business and the end user qualifies as a third party.
A service provider is a company that delivers specific services to another organization. Examples include cloud storage providers, web hosting companies, and SaaS (Software as a Service) platforms.
Third-party service providers are external entities that support businesses by handling specialized functions. These may include services such as payment processing, data storage, customer support, or analytics—allowing companies to streamline operations through outsourcing.





Calistant may receive personal data about you from various external sources, including third-party health integrations, service providers, research collaborators, marketing and advertising partners, and social media platforms. This information is used to enhance the Services and offer a more personalized and secure experience.

Service Providers.
Authorized service providers may share information with Calistant as part of their role in supporting the functionality of the Services. For example, usage behavior and interaction patterns may be provided by analytics services to improve user experience, identify performance issues, or ensure system security. Communication tools may also share data to help respond to inquiries or support requests.
Research Partners.
Participation in surveys or research activities may involve sharing certain personal information, such as demographic details, health goals, or responses related to how Calistant is used. This information helps support product development, academic collaboration, and service improvement.
Marketing and Advertising Partners.
Calistant may work with third-party marketing firms who provide insights such as general interest categories, demographic data, or engagement metrics based on your interactions with online ads. This allows for more relevant messaging and content to be shown to users where permitted by applicable law and user consent.
Business Partners.
If Calistant collaborates with external companies to co-offer services or bundled functionality, relevant personal information may be shared between systems to support your access and ensure consistent experience. This may include information such as user ID, subscription status, or limited profile data.
Information Shared by Other Calistant Users.
Should Calistant enable social features such as friend lists or shared activity logs, personal content like messages, achievements, photos, or diary entries may be shared with others. In such cases, you may also receive content or references from other users that include identifiable information.
Social Media Platforms.
Users may optionally choose to connect Calistant accounts with certain social media services (e.g., for sign-in or content sharing). If this option is used, Calistant may receive data from your connected social media profile, such as your name, profile image, contact details, and visible connections, subject to that platform’s privacy settings and policies.
Connected Health Devices.
If Calistant is integrated with compatible connected devices—such as activity trackers, smart scales, heart rate monitors, glucose monitors, or other wearables—it may receive activity and biometric data with your explicit permission. This may include steps, heart rate, sleep data, weight, and workout sessions.



How We Use Your Personal Information
Calistant may use the personal information we collect for the purposes outlined below, or as otherwise clearly communicated at the time the data is collected. Please note that any activity-based data (such as logged meals, calories, or fitness routines) is used solely for delivering the core functionality of the Calistant platform and is never sold or disclosed to third parties outside of these service-related purposes.
Service Functionality and User Experience
Personal information may be processed to:
•	Operate, maintain, and enhance the features and performance of the Calistant platform
•	Create and manage your user profile and account
•	Communicate essential service information, including app updates, notifications, account-related alerts, and administrative notices
•	Customize your experience and content based on preferences, habits, and usage behavior
•	Provide timely technical assistance, handle support requests, and address user inquiries or concerns
In cases where social or community-based features are available—such as progress sharing or leaderboard-style modules—certain metrics (e.g., steps taken, meals logged, achievements) may be shared with other users for engagement purposes. Such data will always be limited to defined groups or communities (e.g., challenge participants, personal support circles) and will never be made publicly visible or shared across unrelated user groups. No individual activity data is used for advertising or external profiling.
Research and Product Development
We may use collected information in support of product improvement, usability research, and service development. As part of this process, user data may be transformed into aggregated or anonymized forms—ensuring that no individual can be identified. This anonymous data may be used internally or shared with research partners for purposes such as statistical analysis, service optimization, or academic collaboration. All such processing is conducted in compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
Legal Compliance and Security
Calistant may also process personal information when necessary to:
•	Meet legal obligations or respond to valid governmental or regulatory requests (e.g., court orders, subpoenas)
•	Protect the rights, safety, and property of users, Calistant personnel, or the general public
•	Ensure compliance with internal policies and external legal or contractual requirements
•	Enforce the Terms of Use or any other applicable policies
•	Detect, investigate, and respond to potential security breaches, fraudulent behavior, or unauthorized use of the platform, including measures to prevent identity theft or misuse

How We Share Personal Information
Calistant may share personal data with specific categories of third parties, always in alignment with the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and applicable legal requirements.

Business Affiliates and Partners
In cases where Calistant collaborates with other companies to deliver certain aspects of the Service, limited personal information may be shared with those partners when necessary. This includes scenarios where features are co-developed, bundled, or provided through integrations with external platforms.
Service Providers and Vendors
We rely on trusted third-party vendors to support day-to-day operations and to help deliver Calistant’s functionality. These service providers may include providers of hosting and cloud infrastructure, payment processors, customer service platforms (such as virtual assistants or chatbots), data analytics providers, market researchers, IT consultants, auditors, and legal advisors. These entities only access your data for purposes directly tied to their services and are contractually bound to protect your information.
Other Calistant Users (in Social Features)
If you choose to use Calistant’s community-driven or social features—such as activity sharing, group tracking, or interactive logs—certain personal information you post (e.g., username, shared goals, images, comments) may be visible to others in those spaces. Visibility is based on your settings, and you can manage what is shared through your in-app privacy controls. We encourage all users to review these settings regularly.
Advertising and Marketing Platforms
Where permitted by law and based on your preferences, Calistant may share device information, engagement patterns, or usage data with third-party marketing partners. This includes platforms like ad networks, analytics services, and social media platforms that assist in displaying, measuring, and optimizing promotional campaigns.
Analytics and Measurement Tools
To better understand how the platform is used and to refine our offerings, we may share anonymized or usage-based data with analytics partners. These tools help us analyze functionality, performance, and audience behavior both within Calistant and across external marketing efforts
Research Collaborators
If you participate in studies, product feedback sessions, or academic collaborations, we may share relevant information (with appropriate safeguards) with external research partners. These partners are obligated to process the information solely for the intended research purpose.
Business Transitions and Corporate Restructuring
In the event of a potential merger, acquisition, financing, asset transfer, reorganization, or bankruptcy, personal data may be disclosed or transferred as part of due diligence or completion of the transaction. Any such sharing would follow applicable privacy laws, and reasonable steps would be taken to ensure protection of your data during and after the process.
Legal and Regulatory Requirements
Calistant may disclose personal information where required to comply with applicable laws, court orders, or legitimate requests from governmental and law enforcement authorities. This may also include disclosures for tax, audit, compliance, or public safety reasons.
With Your Consent or Instruction
In specific cases, Calistant may share your personal information if you instruct us to do so or provide explicit consent. For example, if you enter a public contest, we may disclose your name to publish a winner’s list, as required by local regulations.
Protecting Rights and Preventing Harm

2.protect other users or the public from harm or legal violation;
3. detect and address fraud, abuse, unauthorized access, or criminal behavior;
4. enforce applicable policies or terms of use;
5. pursue legal remedies or mitigate potential legal damages.


How Calistant Retains Your Information
Calistant retains your personal information for as long as it is needed to support the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including to comply with legal, regulatory, or reporting obligations. In some cases, applicable laws may require us to store certain data for a longer period, or allow us to retain it for archiving or business continuity purposes.
When determining how long to retain specific types of personal data, we consider several factors, including: the volume and sensitivity of the information, the potential risks associated with unauthorized access or disclosure, the reason the information was collected, whether the intended purpose can still be met, and any legal obligations or industry standards that apply.
In situations where data is transformed into a de-identified format (meaning it no longer directly or indirectly identifies an individual), Calistant may retain and use such anonymized information for analytical, research, or service improvement purposes. Re-identifying de-identified data is never attempted unless required or explicitly allowed by law.

How Calistant Protects Your Information
Calistant implements a combination of technical, organizational, and administrative measures to help safeguard your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These safeguards are designed in accordance with industry best practices and are regularly reviewed to ensure ongoing data protection.
However, it is important to note that no system or method of electronic data storage or transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be fully secure. While Calistant takes reasonable steps to protect your information, absolute security cannot be assured.

Your Privacy Rights
Depending on your place of residence, you may have specific legal rights regarding how your personal information is collected, used, stored, and shared. Calistant respects these rights and is committed to supporting individuals in exercising them in accordance with applicable laws.
Right to Access and Data Portability
You may have the right to request confirmation about whether Calistant processes your personal information and to access or receive a copy of your data in a commonly used, portable format, when technically feasible.
Right to Deletion

Right to Correction
If any personal information we hold is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to request that it be corrected, taking into account the nature of the data and the purposes for which it is processed.
Right to Limit or Opt Out of Specific Processing
Where allowed by law, you may be entitled to opt out of the following:
•	Any activities that qualify as the "sale" or “sharing” of personal data, which may include use of certain cookies and analytics or advertising tools.
•	The use of your personal information for targeted advertising or behavioral profiling.
•	Automated processing that may result in decisions based solely on profiling, where such activities have legal or significant effects on you.
You can learn more or adjust your cookie and marketing preferences by reviewing the Marketing and Personalization Preferences section of this Policy.
Right to Consent for Sensitive Information
In jurisdictions that regulate the use of sensitive data, you may be required to explicitly opt in before we can collect or process certain sensitive information (such as health-related data) for purposes outside of delivering core app functionality.
Right to Non-Discrimination
Calistant will never deny access to our services, reduce functionality, or impose penalties if you choose to exercise your legal privacy rights.
